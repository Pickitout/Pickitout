- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pickitout

- 👀 I’m interested in programming and software development.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Java, HTML, CSS, and fine tuning my skills in Python and C#

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on working on any types of projects that I could learn more information about the knowledge I know, along with learning new tools to add to my bag
